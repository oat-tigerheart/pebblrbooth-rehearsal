# HeadKit Starter

**Reference storefront template** for the HeadKit commerce platform — a production-ready Next.js 16 storefront powered by WooCommerce.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 24
- Bun >= 1.3
- A WooCommerce site with the HeadKit theme installed

The starter runs within the monorepo and requires the GraphQL gateway and commerce services for full functionality. Use `bun run dev` from the monorepo root to start all services together.

## Features

- **Home Page** — Hero carousel, featured products, new arrivals, categories, brands, blog, newsletter
- **Collections** — Infinite scroll, filters (category, brand, attributes, price, stock), sort, breadcrumbs
- **Product Detail** — Variable products with swatch selectors, URL-synced variant params, quantity selector, image gallery with lightbox, tabs (description, additional info, reviews)
- **Cart** — Slide-out drawer, optimistic updates, stock validation, coupon support
- **Checkout** — Multi-step flow (contact, delivery, shipping, payment) with Stripe Checkout Session + Stripe Elements
- **Account** — Login, register, password reset, profile, order history, wishlist
- **Search** — Full-text product search with debounced input
- **Blog / News** — Posts with categories, featured images, block editor content
- **Brands** — Brand listing and detail pages
- **SEO** — JSON-LD (product, breadcrumb, article, FAQ, website, searchbox), sitemap, robots.txt, OpenGraph, Twitter cards
- **CMS** — WordPress block editor integration for custom page content
- **Performance** — Next.js 16.3 Instant Navigations (`cacheComponents` + `partialPrefetching`), `"use cache"` directives, route-level Suspense boundaries, loading skeletons, error boundaries

```

## Quick Start

```bash
# From the monorepo root
bun install
cp apps/starter/.env.example apps/starter/.env.local

# Edit .env.local with your HeadKit API keys
bun run dev --filter=starter
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

| Directory                | Description                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/`                   | Next.js App Router pages and layouts                     |
| `overrides/`             | Customer-owned UI/styling (preferred customisation path) |
| `components/ui/`         | Low-level primitives (shadcn-like)                       |
| `components/headkit-ui/` | Commerce-specific components                             |
| `components/seo/`        | JSON-LD, sitemap utilities                               |
| `lib/`                   | SDK, env, cart, checkout helpers                         |

### Customising the storefront

1. **Dashboard branding** — colours, fonts, corners, icons (no code).
2. **`overrides/`** — preferred place for CSS and future UI overrides; safe across template upgrades.
3. **Full repo** — escape hatch for deep changes; expect manual merges when upgrading the starter.

See [`overrides/README.md`](./overrides/README.md) for CSS hook classes. Agents should read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## SEO Features

- **Dynamic sitemap** — Products, collections, brands, and posts in `app/sitemap.ts`
- **robots.txt** — `app/robots.ts` with allow/disallow rules for account, checkout, API, search
- **JSON-LD** — Product, breadcrumb, article, FAQ, website, searchbox (see `components/seo/`)
- **Metadata** — OpenGraph, Twitter cards, canonical URLs

## Standalone vs Monorepo

The starter depends on `@headkit/sdk` (workspace) and backend services (gateway, commerce). For local development, run from the monorepo root:

```bash
# From headkit-platform root — starts gateway, commerce, and starter
bun run dev
```

To run only the starter (requires gateway/commerce already running):

```bash
bun run dev --filter=starter
```

## Customization

### Theme

Edit `app/globals.css` to change the color palette. Brand tokens live in
plain `@theme` (so runtime branding can override them); `purple-500` tracks
`--color-primary` for hovers and accents:

```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: #7f54b3;
  --color-secondary: #000000;
  --color-primary-text: #ffffff;
  --color-purple-500: var(--color-primary);
}
```

### Components

This starter uses the `@headkit/ui` component system. Components live in two layers:

- `components/ui/` — Low-level primitives (button, input, dialog, etc.)
- `components/headkit-ui/` — Commerce components (product-card, cart-drawer, etc.)

Add or update components:

```bash
npx @headkit/ui add product-card cart-drawer
npx @headkit/ui list --installed
```

Component config lives in `headkit-ui.config.json`. The CSS path is `app/globals.css` (no `src/` prefix).

### SDK

The SDK is available as a singleton in `lib/sdk.ts` (public) and `lib/sdk.server.ts` (server-side). All environment variables are validated via Zod in `lib/env.ts`.

```typescript
import { headkit } from "@/lib/sdk";
const product = await headkit.products.get("product-slug");
```

## Testing

```bash
bun run test         # Run Vitest once
bun run test:watch   # Watch mode for development
```

See `lib/checkout-success-utils.test.ts` for an example of unit tests.

## Deployment

Deploy to Vercel (HeadKit-controlled). Set all required environment variables in production. See the [root README](../../README.md) for full platform deployment.

- Zod — Runtime validation
- Radix UI — Accessible primitives

## The `@headkit/sdk` pin, and how it silently breaks every new store

This app is mirrored to `HeadKit-Commerce/headkit-starter` by `subtree-mirror.yml`, and that template
is what `CreateFromTemplate` clones for every customer store. **The mirror rewrites the `@headkit/sdk`
dependency to an EXACT published version read from `packages/sdk/package.json`.**

That creates a trap which cost the template two months of broken builds:

- in this monorepo, `apps/starter` resolves `@headkit/sdk` through the **bun workspace link**, so it
  compiles against `packages/sdk` **source**;
- in the template, it resolves the **published** package from Artifact Registry.

If you add something to `packages/sdk` and use it here **without bumping
`packages/sdk/package.json`**, this repo type-checks and CI goes green — while the template installs
a published version that does not contain it. Every store created from the template then fails its
first build, and nothing in this repo reports it.

It is worse than a stale pin, because `changeset publish` **refuses to republish an existing
version**. The release run then reports:

```
warn @headkit/sdk is not being published because version X is already published on npm
warn No unpublished projects to publish
```

and exits **green**, which reads as "nothing to do" rather than "you are shipping stale code under a
version number that already means something else".

**So: any change to `packages/sdk` that this app consumes MUST come with a version bump** (a
changeset, or a direct bump to `packages/sdk/package.json`). Merging to `main` publishes it.

Two ordering notes:

1. `Version and Publish` and `Mirror Starter` race on the same push. The mirror's registry gate fails
   closed on `main`, so on a bump merge it will refuse with `does not resolve in <registry>`. That is
   correct behaviour — re-run the mirror after the publish finishes, do not weaken the gate.
2. A red `Version and Publish` does not mean nothing published. The GitHub Release step runs after the
   npm publish and fails independently. Check Artifact Registry before concluding anything.

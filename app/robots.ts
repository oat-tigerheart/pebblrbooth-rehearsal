/**
 * robots.txt, decided by HOSTNAME first (MIG-03, T-15.1-08-01).
 *
 * Order matters. The host predicate is consulted BEFORE — and independently of
 * — the branding read, because every failure mode of that read currently opens
 * indexing: `getBranding()` returns DEFAULT_BUNDLE (both SEO gates enabled)
 * when the dashboard env is unset AND from a bare catch on any thrown read. A
 * temporary migration host must serve `Disallow: /` and advertise no sitemap
 * whatever branding says, so the decision cannot depend on branding at all.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT keyed on the Vercel deployment-environment variable: it
 * reads "production" for a production deployment served at ANY host, including
 * the rehearsal host this route exists to close. That variable is therefore
 * never read here — see lib/host-indexing.ts, which names it in full.
 *
 * Deployment Protection is explicitly NOT the mechanism (T-15.1-08-02). It
 * would 401 Stripe's unauthenticated fetch of
 * /.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association, so the payment
 * method domain never activates and Apple Pay renders an empty button — while
 * the operator's own curl, carrying a bypass cookie, returns 200 and the check
 * goes green. /robots.txt and /.well-known/* must stay reachable unauthenticated.
 *
 * Reading the Host header makes this route dynamic; it therefore carries no
 * cache directive by design.

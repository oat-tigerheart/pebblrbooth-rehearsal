/**
 * Shop catch-all path resolver — D-15-04 / RESEARCH C-6.
 *
 * `/shop/[...slug]` serves two different things under one catch-all: nested
 * product URLs (`/shop/{cat}[/{sub}]/{slug}`, the shape WordPress mints for
 * WooCommerce products) and category archives (`/shop/{cat}`). The replaced
 * implementation took `slug[slug.length - 1]` unconditionally, so a category
 * URL was treated as a product slug and permanently redirected into a route
 * that answered not-found.
 *
 * Deciding correctly requires consulting the category tree, which is what this
 * module does: flatten the tree into the set of valid segment chains, then
 * match longest-chain-first. A path whose leading segments are not a valid
 * chain is `unknown` — an explicit failure to decide, never a guessed product.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free by design (no SDK, no `next`, no `@/lib`) so it is
 * unit-testable without a backend. `walkCategoryChains` below duplicates the
 * algorithm of `walkCategoryPaths` in `app/sitemap.ts` deliberately, to keep
 * that purity; the two must be changed together.

/**

 *
 * The schema and the Go domain type document `uri` as relative, but

 * Correcting that upstream is explicitly deferred (15.1-CONTEXT `<deferred>`),
 * so the consumer normalises — the same compensation `lib/convert-uri.ts`
 * already applies for navigation links.
 *
 * The origin is DISCARDED rather than compared against the storefront origin.
 * In a headless store the WordPress origin is a different host by design (e.g.
 * `commerce.example.com` vs `www.example.com`), so an origin-equality test
 * would reject every product in every store. Callers re-root the returned path
 * under the configured site url, which makes an off-site URL impossible by
 * construction — a stronger guarantee than the comparison would have given.
 *
 * Returns null when no safe path can be derived: blank input, a
 * protocol-relative reference (path-like but resolves off-site when joined to a
 * base url), a non-http(s) scheme, or an unparseable value.

/**
 * Nested shop route — D-15-04, replacing the permanent redirect to
 * `/products/{slug}`.
 *
 * WordPress mints WooCommerce product permalinks as `/shop/{cat}[/{sub}]/{slug}`
 * and those are the URLs live stores have indexed. The replaced implementation
 * answered every such URL with a 308 to a flat path. Two problems:
 *
 *  1. A 308 is cached by clients indefinitely, so it is the one act in a
 *     migration that a rollback cannot undo — after a flip back, those clients
 *     keep requesting a path the old stack never served.
 *  2. It took `slug[slug.length - 1]` unconditionally and so could not tell a
 *     product slug from a category slug, redirecting category URLs into a
 *     product route that answered not-found (RESEARCH C-6) — live for every
 *     store on this template, not just the migrating one.
 *
 * This route therefore serves real pages: `resolveShopPath` decides
 * category-vs-product from the category tree, and rendering is delegated to the
 * existing flat-PDP and collection views so the compositions cannot drift.
 * No permanent redirect is issued from this namespace.
 *
 * The flat `/products/{slug}` route is untouched and keeps serving its own URLs;
 * this adds a second valid shape rather than removing one.
 */

 * Category tree for path classification.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wrapped in a catch: the SDK returns null/empty for genuinely
 * absent data, so a THROWN error is transport/infra. Swallowing it would leave
 * an empty tree, which classifies every nested PDP as unknown and bakes a
 * sticky 404 into the route cache. Let it propagate — Next then serves the last
 * good render and retries. Same rationale as app/collections/[...slug]/page.tsx.

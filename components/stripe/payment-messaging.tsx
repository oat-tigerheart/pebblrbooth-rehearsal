/**
 * Stripe's Payment Method Messaging Element — the "4 interest-free payments of
 * $X" badge.
 *
 * TWO THINGS HERE ARE LATE-BOUND ON PURPOSE.
 *
 * 1. `paymentMethodTypes` is NOT passed. Stripe's docs: "If you use Dynamic
 *    payment methods, the Payment Method Messaging Element automatically pulls
 *    your payment method preferences from the Stripe Dashboard." Commerce runs
 *    dynamic payment methods, so omitting the option is what makes this badge
 *    reflect the MERCHANT's own enabled providers, currency and amount. Every
 *    previous HeadKit implementation passed ["klarna","afterpay_clearpay",
 *    "affirm"], which silently opted out of exactly that. The option is
 *    optional in `StripePaymentMethodMessagingElementOptions`, so it is simply
 *    omitted rather than passed as `undefined`.
 *
 * 2. `stripeAccount` IS passed. Commerce creates DIRECT charges on the connected
 *    account, and Stripe requires direct-charge platforms to identify the
 *    account that renders this element. Without it the badge would describe the
 *    PLATFORM's payment methods, not the merchant's.
 *
 * `countryCode` is deliberately omitted — it is optional and Stripe infers the
 * buyer's country, which is more accurate than anything we could pass.
 *
 * CORE WEB VITALS. Stripe.js is ~247 KB and this badge is decorative, so it must
 * never compete with hydration or LCP. An earlier integration was withdrawn for
 * exactly that reason; it used dynamic import + a Suspense skeleton but still
 * requested Stripe.js from a mount effect, i.e. in the initial burst.
 *
 * BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THE OBSERVER BUYS. It does NOT wait for a scroll. This
 * badge sits directly under the Add-to-Cart row, which on a desktop PDP is
 * normally above the fold — measured locally at 309 px into a 720 px viewport —
 * and `rootMargin` widens the trigger zone by a further 200 px. An
 * IntersectionObserver fires its first callback within roughly one frame of
 * `observe()`, so on a typical PDP load Stripe.js is requested about one frame
 * after hydration, with no user gesture involved. What the observer reliably
 * buys is: the request leaves the render path, and a badge genuinely far down
 * the page costs nothing until approached.
 *
 * The CWV numbers are therefore NOT yet verified for this placement. LCP should
 * be unaffected (the script is async and post-paint); TBT/INP is the metric at
 * risk. Task 7 Step 4 of the plan takes the real measurement on a deployed
 * store, and prescribes layering `requestIdleCallback` on top of the observer
 * if it regresses. Do not quote a long-task or CLS figure here until that runs.
 *
 * EMPTY STATE. Stripe renders nothing when no plan is eligible — verified live:
 * an account with no eligible provider produces a host div of height 0 and no
 * iframe at all. So neither height NOR margin may be reserved up front; the
 * spacing below is applied only once Stripe has actually painted something.

   * True once Stripe has painted a real MESSAGE into the host — not merely

   *
   * Stripe decides eligibility server-side, and there are three distinct
   * outcomes, all measured live against the real API:
   *
   * | outcome                                   | iframe | host |
   * |-------------------------------------------|--------|------|

   * | accepted, but NO provider enabled         |  9px   |  1px |
   * | accepted, Afterpay + Klarna eligible      | 48px   | 40px |
   *
   * The middle row is why a bare `> 0` test is wrong: an account with the
   * toggle on but no BNPL provider enabled paints a 9 px sliver that shows the
   * shopper nothing, yet would claim the full 24 px margin below. Since the
   * element is a cross-origin iframe we cannot inspect, painted height is the
   * only signal available — so the threshold has to sit between "sliver" and
   * "line of text" rather than at zero.

 * Server-rendered pending/processing screen for async payment methods (session
 * complete but payment_status unpaid) and for the paid-but-unresolved-order
 * fallback — a paying customer must never be silently bounced to the homepage.
 * Used by both checkout return pages (/checkout/success and
 * /checkout/success/[orderId], ENG-789).
 *
 * ENG-784: when `sessionId` is provided, a client poller upgrades this static
 * screen — it polls the session every 2.5s (≤60s) and auto-routes to the order
 * confirmation once paid, or to the error page on cancel/expiry. The poller
 * only reads/routes; the webhook remains the sole capture authority (D4).

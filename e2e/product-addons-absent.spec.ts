/**
 * WooCommerce Product Add-Ons end-to-end — the plugin-ABSENT half (phase 14.1,
 * plan 14.1-09). This file is the PAO-04 gate.
 *
 * PAO-04 is the one requirement in this phase that no amount of careful
 * implementation can satisfy. Every layer claims to degrade cleanly — the theme
 * omits a key behind a `class_exists`, the mapper turns a missing key into an
 * empty list, the schema types the field `[ProductAddon!]!` with an empty
 * default, `ProductAddons` returns `null` for an empty list and its call site
 * guards on length so not even a margin enters the DOM. Each claim is tested at
 * the layer that made it. None of that is evidence that the COMPOSITION
 * degrades cleanly. Only a completed run with the plugin deactivated is.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE FALSE-PASS GUARD — read this before changing a fixture
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This gate is unusually easy to fake, and this phase has already been bitten by
 * both mechanisms:
 *
 * 1. A SELF-SKIPPING SUITE. `gift-card.spec.ts`'s health-probe convention skips
 *    when its prerequisite is missing. That is right for a paid gift-card code
 *    CI cannot provision and WRONG here: a spec whose fixture is reachable only
 *    BECAUSE the plugin is active will skip every assertion on exactly the run
 *    that was meant to falsify it, and report green. So:
 *
 *      - The ONLY skip in this file gates on the stack being reachable at all
 *        (`stackIsUp()`), exactly as `product-addons.spec.ts` does. There is no
 *        skip in any add-on assertion path. An unmet precondition FAILS.
 *      - The seeded fixtures are ORDINARY PURCHASABLE PRODUCTS. They resolve,
 *        render and add to cart for reasons that have nothing to do with their
 *        add-ons, so every assertion below runs in BOTH plugin states. Do not
 *        later turn a fixture into an add-on-only product: that silently
 *        disarms this gate.
 *      - The harness compares this run's total case count against the
 *        plugin-active run's. A silent skip shows up as a smaller number.
 *
 * 2. A RANDOM DISCRIMINATOR. `scripts/verify-pao-plugin-absence.sh` exists
 *    because the original payload diff failed on `.related`, which
 *    `wc_get_related_products()` orders by `RAND()` — it passed or failed at
 *    random (14.1-01). Nothing here diffs a whole payload; every assertion below
 *    names the property it measures.
 *
 * And element absence alone cannot see a ZERO-HEIGHT WRAPPER: a container with
 * no children satisfies every `not.toBeVisible()` check while still occupying
 * the DOM and the layout. Assertion 3 is therefore a measured number
 * (UI-SPEC Checker Sign-Off recommendation 2), not a presence check.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHICH CASES DISCRIMINATE, AND WHICH ARE INVARIANTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Stated plainly so nobody reads a green run as more than it is. Run this file
 * with the plugin ACTIVE and these FAIL — they are the gate:
 *
 *   - `the product endpoint omits the addons key`      (key is present)
 *   - `the gateway returns an empty list`              (5 groups come back)
 *   - `no add-on element renders on any PDP`           (groups render)
 *   - `no heading divider`                             (the divider renders)
 *   - `the variation block is adjacent to availability`(the form sits between)
 *   - `an add-on fixture is an ordinary product`       (bare add-item 400s on a
 *                                                       required group)
 *   - `an order from an unconfigured fixture`          (same 400)
 *   - `an add-on fixture's cart line matches a plain line` (same 400 — the cart
 *                                                       cannot even be seeded)
 *   - `both order surfaces match`                      (same 400, via the
 *                                                       in-run order)
 *   - `the console is clean` (same 400, via the in-run order)
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NO RECORDED CONSTANT IS AN ASSERTION HERE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Three cases used to compare against values measured on one machine — a
 * `sha256(outerHTML)` prefix, two pixel heights, an order id and key, and two
 * verbatim console strings. All five described the authoring stack rather than
 * the property under test, and all five failed on CI while passing locally
 * (run 31788350275). They now derive their baseline IN THE SAME RUN as the
 * assertion:
 *
 *   - the cart and order line shapes are compared against a PLAIN product's
 *     line rendered beside them on the same surface;
 *   - the order is PLACED by the run and carries both products;
 *   - console messages are tolerated by CLASS, never by recorded text.
 *
 * None of them is gated on an "only run locally" flag: that would be the
 * self-skipping hole above wearing a different hat, and CI would go green
 * measuring nothing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * UI-SPEC "Absent-Plugin Contract (PAO-04)" — the five assertions, mapped
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   1. No group name, `*` marker, "Your selection" panel, "Options" panel
 *      anywhere → `endpoint and gateway` case 3; `cart, order and account` all.
 *   2. No `<hr>`/divider only a `type: heading` entry produces → case 4.
 *   3. The PDP rhythm between the variation block and the availability row is
 *      unchanged, asserted as computed spacing → case 5.
 *   4. Zero console warnings or errors → case 10.
 *   5. `AddonDetails` renders nothing on every cart, checkout and confirmation
 *      line → cases 6, 7, 8, 9; plus the wire contract in cases 1 and 2.
 *
 * THE ONE UNREACHABLE SURFACE. The checkout summary is not observable on this
 * stack and was not for 14.1-06 or 14.1-07 either: `/checkout` mints a Stripe
 * Checkout Session during SSR and commerce holds `sk_test_…placeholder`, so it
 * 307s to `/checkout/error`; the documented free-cart branch returns BEFORE the
 * `{checkoutSession ? …}` block that holds `<Cart>`. Rather than a `test.fixme`
 * — a skip by another name in a file whose central prohibition is that nothing
 * self-skips — it is stated here as a recorded environment gap. The summary line
 * IS `LineItemDisplay`, whose no-add-on shape is asserted below on two other
 * surfaces and whose call site `line-item-display.test.tsx` pins. A real
 * `sk_test_` key on commerce is the prerequisite (14.1-06 deferred item 5).
 *
 * LOCAL-ONLY (HARD RULE): every endpoint is a localhost Docker service. This
 * spec places real orders on the LOCAL store, which is what an order-surface
 * assertion is: one shared two-line order for the order surfaces (cases 8 and
 * 10) and one single-line order for case 9's wire read.
 *
 * THIS SPEC MUTATES NO PLUGIN STATE. It never activates, deactivates or
 * configures a WordPress plugin and contains no shell escape. Taking the plugin
 * offline is `e2e/run-plugin-absent-suite.sh`'s job, because that action needs a
 * restore trap registered before it and this file must stay runnable in both
 * states.
 *
 * PREREQUISITES: the stack up, `docker/wordpress/seed-product-addons.php`
 * applied, and — for the gate run only — Product Add-Ons DEACTIVATED by the
 * harness.

 * `line-item-display.tsx` and `cart-item.tsx` render `<AddonDetails>` as a

 * and the root-vs-first-child height comparison are what see it.
 *
 * WHY NOT A RECORDED CONSTANT. Plans 14.1-06 and 14.1-09 pinned these to

 * hash is a property of the build, the image URLs and the price formatting, not
 * of add-on absence: CI renders the same product at the same price and produces

 * recorded. Every baseline below is therefore derived IN THE SAME RUN as the

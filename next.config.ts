 *
 * Always allowlisted:
 *  - `storage.googleapis.com` — GCS-served static media for the SDK/commerce
 *    catalog AND dashboard-api branding (logo/icon) assets (FE-08).
 *  - `localhost` — local WP/WC media host for local Docker dev (WP on :8090,
 *    served over http).
 *
 * Conditionally allowlisted:
 *  - `process.env.IMAGE_DOMAIN` — a deploy's configured image host; pushed
 *    ONLY when non-empty.

 * OLD host — while newly-read media resolves against the new one. Dishee's home
 * carousel referenced `commerce.dishee.com.au` while every product image came
 * from the clone.
 *
 * A host missing from this allowlist does not degrade: the optimizer answers
 * 400 and the image renders broken, with `naturalWidth` 0 and a 200 on the page
 * around it. Nothing reports it. (400 = refused by this allowlist, 404 =
 * allowed through and simply absent upstream — a useful way to tell them apart
 * when diagnosing.)
 *
 * Still an explicit allowlist, never a wildcard host — the optimizer is an SSRF
 * surface, so entries stay exact hostnames.

 * Version skew: a browser holding the previous build's client bundle keeps
 * requesting the previous build's chunks. With a deployment id, Next detects
 * the mismatch and performs a hard navigation instead of failing the request.
 *
 * Deployment verification: a deployment reporting `state: READY` is not the
 * same claim as "the DOMAIN serves that deployment", and nothing observable
 * from outside separates them unless the served HTML carries the id. Reading
 * it off the page is the only way to assert that a sweep of a live storefront
 * describes ONE deployment rather than a mixture of two mid-rollout — which is
 * what a migration cutover is.
 *
 * `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_ID` is injected by Vercel at build. Off Vercel — local
 * dev, Docker, CI — both are unset, this resolves to `undefined`, the key is
 * omitted, and Next behaves exactly as it did before. Vercel's Skew Protection
 * toggle sets the same thing, but per project: doing it here makes it a
 * property of the template every store inherits, rather than a checkbox each
 * new store can be created without.

 * FLAT list — every category, at the top level — so reading `.map(n => n.slug)`
 * saw all of them. MIG-03 made it return a real tree: roots at the top level,
 * subcategories nested underneath. A top-level-only read therefore silently
 * stopped seeing subcategories, and every consumer that treats "absent from
 * this set" as "empty" began classifying every subcategory as empty.
 *
 * The visible symptom was menus: a parent whose children were all subcategories
 * lost all of them, so it rendered as a plain link instead of a dropdown
 * trigger, and its whole mega-menu disappeared from the site.
 *
 * Slugs are trimmed and lowercased because callers match case-insensitively
 * against slugs parsed out of URLs and WP CSS classes.

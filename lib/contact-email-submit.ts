/**
 * Pure, node-testable extraction of the contact-step handleSubmit branch
 * order (ENG-801). Reproduces the component's branches EXACTLY:
 *
 *   (a) "recreate"     — the email changed and a refresh path exists: the
 *                        session must be recreated (Stripe render-locks a
 *                        `customer_email` set at create; recreate-then-
 *                        updateEmail is the ENG-801 model).
 *   (b) "advance"      — the email is unchanged, a prefill exists, AND the
 *                        session already carries an email: Stripe forbids
 *                        `updateEmail` with an unchanged email, so just move
 *                        to the next step.
 *   (c) "update-email" — everything else: push the email onto the session
 *                        (`actions.updateEmail`) and the cart before advancing.
 *
 * WHY branch (c) matters — the safety net: sessions are created email-LESS
 * (ENG-801) and the returning-shopper prefill is applied at PROVIDER mount
 * (CheckoutElementsProvider `options.defaultValues.email`). A session's
 * email can therefore still be empty at submit time: the prefill arrived
 * async (after provider mount, missed by defaultValues) or the bounded
 * updateEmail push in CheckoutSteps has not landed yet. Submitting an
 * UNCHANGED prefill against such a session must NOT be swallowed by branch
 * (b): `sessionEmail` reads empty, so branch (c) fires and pushes the email
 * onto the session before the step advances. The bounded push is only a
 * loop-guarded best effort — this submit path is the guarantee.
 *
 * Emails are normalized (trim + lowercase) before comparison, mirroring the
 * component. A `null`/`undefined` sessionEmail means the checkout state is
 * not "success"; that maps to `stripeHasNoEmail === false` in the component
 * (the condition requires a successful state), so an unchanged prefill still
 * advances. Pure: no I/O, no Stripe types.
